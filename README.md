# caboodle

An ode to a childhood favorite coming back to life! A few days ago, I purchased the same caboodle I had as a child. I was inspired by the colors and decided to create a mock landing page!

Special thanks and shoutout to Online Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_z5laE4KTw) for the inspiration!!
